# DealOrNoDeal
This program is a version of the popular reality show "Deal or No Deal". In this version of "Deal or No Deal," players start by selecting one unopened briefcase containing a hidden prize value. They then progressively reveal the values in other briefcases while aiming to eliminate lower values. At intervals, they receive offers from a hypothetical banker based on the remaining values and must decide whether to "deal" (accept the offer) or "no deal" (continue playing). The objective is to win as much money as possible by either accepting a profitable offer or holding out for the highest prize hidden in their selected briefcase. The game ends when they either accept an offer or open all other briefcases, revealing their ultimate prize in the chosen case.
